## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Development Process

We use GitHub to sync code to and from our public repository. We'll use GitHub to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch** from `main` with a descriptive name:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/add-validation-command
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the development guidelines

3. **Test thoroughly**:

   ```bash
   go test ./...
   go build ./cmd/proton
   ./proton generate --help
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** with conventional commit messages

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run specific package tests
go test ./internal/config

# Run integration tests
go test ./tests/...
```

### Writing Tests

- Place unit tests in the same package as the code
- Use descriptive test names: `TestConfigLoad_WithValidFile`
- Include table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies when needed

## Release Process

Releases are handled by maintainers:

1. Version tags follow semantic versioning (v1.2.3)
2. Release notes are generated from commit messages
3. GitHub Actions automatically builds and publishes releases
4. Docker images and binaries are published automatically
